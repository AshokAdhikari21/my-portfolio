    title: "Landslide Suspceptibility Mapping",
    description:
      "This project focuses on mapping landslide susceptibility in the Butwal-Tansen section of the Siddhartha Highway using three statistical and machine learning models: Frequency Ratio (FR), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). A landslide inventory was created using historical landslide data, and various conditioning factors like slope, geology, land use, and rainfall were analyzed. Each model was applied to identify high-risk areas and evaluate their predictive accuracy. The results were validated using ROC curves and AUC values. Among the models, Random Forest showed the highest prediction performance. The final susceptibility maps can support disaster risk management and infrastructure planning in the region.",

    title: "Landuse Planning Project",
    description:
      "This project focuses on sustainable landuse planning to optimize the allocation of land resources for various socio-economic and environmental needs. Using GIS and remote sensing tools, current land use patterns were analyzed, and suitability analysis was conducted for residential, agricultural, industrial, and conservation zones. Key factors such as slope, soil type, accessibility, and proximity to infrastructure were considered. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was used to prioritize land suitability. The final land use plan aims to support balanced development, reduce environmental degradation, and guide future urban expansion. Interactive spatial layers and thematic maps were generated to visualize results effectively. This project demonstrates how geospatial technologies can be used for data-driven policy-making and sustainable land management.",

    title: "Engineering Survey Project",
    description:
      "Executed comprehensive field surveys during academic training using Total Station, Theodolite, GNSS, and levelling equipment. The project involved capturing topographic and cadastral data for real-world mapping scenarios. Total Station was used for precise angle and distance measurements, while GNSS provided accurate georeferencing. Levelling was applied for elevation modeling and contour mapping. Additionally, drone-based photogrammetry and GPS surveys were conducted to enhance spatial data accuracy and coverage. Final outputs such as topographic maps, parcel boundaries, and elevation profilesâ€”were produced using GIS software, supporting applications in land administration, urban planning, and infrastructure development.",
